What Is OpenGL?
OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists
of more than 700 distinct commands (about 670 commands as specified for
OpenGL Version 3.0 and another 50 in the OpenGL Utility Library) that
you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce interactive
three-dimensional applications.
