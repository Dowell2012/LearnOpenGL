What Is OpenGL?

OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists
of more than 700 distinct commands (about 670 commands as specified for
OpenGL Version 3.0 and another 50 in the OpenGL Utility Library) that
you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce interactive
three-dimensional applications.
OpenGL is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be
implemented on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these qualities, no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input
are included in OpenGL; instead, you must work through whatever windowing system controls the particular hardware you’re using. Similarly,
OpenGL doesn’t provide high-level commands for describing models of
